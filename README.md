# Emep_cut
Python script that let user chose for which countries he wants to have the data and then creates the folder containing files only with that data. It
allows user to choose the directory path where the source files are in and where to put the results. Directory structure from source files remains
unchanged. 

Folder with sample data called "EMEP2019" has been added. 

Script can be easily modified to work with other text files than EMEP files. 

Function ignore_files was used from geegsforgeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-copy-directory-structure-without-files/)

This is also my first public repository :)
